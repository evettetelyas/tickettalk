<h3>About Our Team</h3>
<p>

  </p>
<p>
  We are four software engineering students at Turing School of Software & Design.
  This app is a group project created over twelve days, during the third module of our four module,
  seven-month, intensive technical education program. The idea came from a real-life
  struggle with Ticketmaster's on-sale process to obtain tickets to some of our favorite,
  very in-demand events. The solution we created is TicketTalk - a way for fans to help
  each other purchase tickets at face value in hopes of avoiding secondary market fees.
</p>
<p>
  TicketTalk is the combination of two Ruby apps communicating together to provide the end
  User Experience. First, we consume the Discovery API from Ticketmaster through a Sinatra microservice.
  This gave us the opportunity to pull the exact event data we wanted to utilize in the Ruby on
  Rails application. The main app includes Google OAuth, PayPal payments, a native review system,
  and some difficult-to-implement chat functionalities utilizing websockets and Action Cable.
  Overall, we are very excited to present this end product and plan to continue enhancing development 
  in the future.
